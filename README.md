# Code Examples

Two examples of React components that use SVG to produce a visualization, one simple (`LabeledTimer`) and one more complex (`TimelineWidget`).

## TimelineWidget

`TimelineWidget` is a Gantt-style visualization, produced with a combination of HTML and SVG.

## LabeledTimer

`LabeledTimer` is a component that combines a label and a circular progress indicator, which is implemented in a standalone `CircleTimer` component.
